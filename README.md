# now-static-build-starter

This is a simple static web app created using Next.js.

## Deploying

~~You need to build the app locally and deploy it using `now`.~~<br/>
With the help of the `docker`, this app will be built inside `now` and deploy it as a static app.

### How it works

* The Next.js app is configured to [export](https://nextjs.org/docs/#static-html-export) static HTML.
* Then we've a simple [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) which builds the Next.js app and export the static content into the `/public` directory.
* The [`now.json`](./now.json) file is used to set the type of this app as `static`. (Otherwise `now` CLI will think this as a typical `docker` app.)
* Finally, you can deploy this app by simply invoking `now`. (Make sure to use the latest release of `now`.)

## Works Best With GitHub

Now's static build support works really great with the [GitHub integration](https://zeit.co/github).<br/>
You can send pull request to the app and Now will build the app and deploy it as a static app for each and every commit.
